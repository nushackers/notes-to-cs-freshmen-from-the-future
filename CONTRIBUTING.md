## Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Intro

Early into the AY12/13 academic year, Prof Tay Yong Chiang organized a supper for Computer Science freshmen at Tembusu College. The bunch of seniors who were gathered there put together a document for NUS computing freshmen. This is that document.

Feel free to create a pull request to edit or add to it, and share it with other freshmen you know.

It is now currently maintained and updated by NUS Hackers.

## What is this document?

This document is a [living document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_document) that aims to provide valuable resources and guidance to incoming
computer science freshmen.

## The goal of this document

The primary goal of this document is to create a repository of knowledge that will cover various aspects
of a freshmen's computing journey. We hope that this document will serve to ease the transition of new students
into the School of Computing (SoC).

## Contributing to the document

As much as possible, we want to adhere to the the overarching ideas in the
[awesome manifesto](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md).

In other words:
- It's curation, not collection. - We want to avoid the document from being to lengthy or diluted.
- Research if the stuff you're including is actually *awesome*. - Only put stuff in that you or another contributor can **personally** recommend.
- You should rather leave stuff out than include too much. - If you're unsure, ask someone else, or comment it in the PR.
- Comment on why something is *awesome* (Not relevant for advice) - If you're recommending a book, or a lecture, tell us why you think it's great.
- Pay attention to grammar. - Ensure your stuff is grammatically correct, typo-free and has no Markdown formatting errors.

## How to contribute

- Create a new fork of the document.
- In your own fork, edit the document and commit it.
    - If you're unfamiliar with markdown, try [this](https://www.markdowntutorial.com).
- Create a Pull Request (PR) to the main document. See the Pull Request Checklist below.
